about=The plugin uses the API provided by the French government (url: https://geo.api.gouv.fr/adresse). The goal is to find or locate addresses on French territory. To search, it's simple, just write the desired address in the search bar. For best results, enter a number, a street name and the postal code. You can also by clicking on the canvas (activate the tool: "Locate on the map.") Recover the address according to the coordinates.
